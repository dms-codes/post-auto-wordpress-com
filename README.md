# WordPress Blog Post Creator

This Python script is designed to automate the process of creating and publishing blog posts on a WordPress website using the WordPress XML-RPC API. It reads data from an Excel file, generates post content, and publishes the blog posts on your WordPress site.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have the following:

- Python installed on your system.
- The `wordpress-xmlrpc` library installed. You can install it using `pip`:
  ```
  pip install python-wordpress-xmlrpc
  ```
- A WordPress website with XML-RPC enabled. You will need the website URL, username, and password to connect to your WordPress site.

## Configuration

In the script, you should configure the following variables:

- `HOME_URL`: Replace with the URL of your WordPress website.
- `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`: Replace with your WordPress username and password.
- `HASHTAG_REPLACE_CHARS`: List of characters to be removed from the product title when generating hashtags.
- `COLUMNS`: Column names from your Excel file that correspond to the data you want to use in your blog posts.

## Usage

1. Prepare your data in an Excel file (`data.xlsx`) with the appropriate columns.

2. Customize the script's configuration variables as mentioned above.

3. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

4. The script will start creating and publishing blog posts based on the data from the Excel file.

5. It will generate hashtags based on the product title, create post content, and publish each post to your WordPress website.

6. The script will output progress information for each post, including the estimated time remaining.

7. The posts will be published on your WordPress site as drafts, and you can review and edit them before publishing them as final posts.

## Example

Suppose you have configured the script with the appropriate variables, and your `data.xlsx` file contains product information.

After running the script, it will start creating and publishing blog posts with titles, content, and hashtags based on the data from the Excel file.

## Security Note

Ensure that you keep your WordPress username and password secure, as they are used to access your WordPress site via the XML-RPC API.
